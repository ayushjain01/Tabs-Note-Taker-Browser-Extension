# <img src="./Icon.png" alt="Extension Icon" width="4%"> Tabs Note Taker Browser Extension

Tabs Note Taker is a browser extension that allows users to store notes about websites they visit directly within their browser. Instead of juggling between different note-taking tools or platforms, users can easily jot down important details about a webpage and save them for future reference.

## üöÄ Features

- Create notes for each tab: When browsing the web, users can open the extension and enter notes specific to the currently active tab. These notes will be associated with the URL of the tab for easy retrieval.

- Persistent storage: The notes are stored locally using the browser's `localStorage`, ensuring that they are retained even after closing and reopening the browser.

- Easy access and retrieval: Users can view and access their stored notes by clicking on the "Stored Tabs" tab, which displays a list of websites they have taken notes for. Clicking on a website from the list will load the associated notes for that website.

- Simple and intuitive interface: The extension provides a user-friendly interface with a text input area for note-taking and clear options for saving, deleting all notes, and selecting specific tabs.
